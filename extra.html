        </aside>
        <p>I used to be a dressage rider, and I'm going to be a software developer. 
            That's why I want to give a short introduction into dressage, allowing you to notice the many subtle and not so subtle similarities between 
            dressage and software development.</p>
        <p>Dressage riding is all about systematically training your horse, to make it stronger, more flexible and more reactive to the rider's aids. 
            It takes many years to achieve the maximum level of physical abilities and obedience. </p>
        <p>When starting to train a young horse, it is of the utmost importance that the trainer always keeps track of the global direction in which the 
            horse needs to evolve. Any shortcuts that are being taken during the training, will inevitably lead to a series of problems at a later time. When 
            a poorly trained horse needs to be corrected, only two questions always come to mind: "Who created this mess", and "How do I start to fix this?"</p>
        <p>During the years of training, riders try to achieve the highest possible reactivity to their aids. A perfectly schooled horse is able to react merely to the rider's 
            thoughts. This makes it seem like the horse is performing its tasks automatically. This can only be achieved if the rider is permanently testing 
            his horses obedience. If the horse fails a test, the rider must take a step back and find out why the horse didn't react the way the rider
             wanted it to.</p>
        <p>While in training, all stakeholders need to regularly communicate with one another, in order to see if the horse is improving as expected, and to 
            discuss the training in the near future. The owner of the horse expresses his or her wishes, the rider and the coach are responsible for the training. 
            Other important team members are the veterinarian and the farrier. Depending on the situation, a groom and physiotherapist might also be a part of
            the team.</p>
        <p>Dressage horses do most of their training in the arena. Unexperienced horses can sometimes have troubles adapting to this environment. It is 
            considered best practice to find a good balance between experienced and unexperienced horses in the arena. If there are too many unexperienced 
            horses in the arena, stress might cause the training to be ineffective. After riding in the arena, make sure to pick up your horses manure. Don't 
            leave that for whomever comes after you.</p>
